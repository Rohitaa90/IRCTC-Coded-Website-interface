# IRCTC-Coded-Website-interface
Iâ€™m excited to share a project I recently completed where I developed a small-scale IRCTC train website interface using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply OOP principles in a practical scenario, resulting in a modular, reusable, and efficient codebase.
